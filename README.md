## Overview

Hermes is a modular framework for node.js based on gRPC that works as a Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) by using the Observable pattern, functioning as the observer between publisher and subscriber communication.

By acting simultaneously as **the bridge for publisher and subscriber communication** and as **the notifications' handler**, Hermes removes the need for a connection with a third party for sending and receiving messages, centralizing and simplifying these functionalities.

Hermes' core features, being fully compatible with gRPC, are:

* Easy integration
* Multi-language communication
* High Performance
* Trustworthy APIs

## Motivations and premises

Our motivation is to turn coding into a more pleasant experience for the developer by making the process simpler, centralized, and better optimized.

Hermes is a **modular framework** for node.js to make gRPC APIs.

We follow a *documentation first* philosophy, with the objective of *quality delivery* focusing on the *developer’s experience*.<br /> Hermes is a tool made *by devs for all devs*,
ranging all the way **from college work to corporate level projects**.

## Overview

Hermes is a modular framework for node.js based on gRPC that works as a Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) by using the Observable pattern, functioning as the observer between publisher and subscriber communication.

By acting simultaneously as **the bridge for publisher and subscriber communication** and as **the notifications' handler**, Hermes removes the need for a connection with a third party for sending and receiving messages, centralizing and simplifying these functionalities.

Hermes' core features, being fully compatible with gRPC, are:

- Easy integration
- Multi-language communication
- High Performance
- Trustworthy APIs

## Our motivations

Our motivation is to turn coding into a more pleasant experience for the developer by making the process simpler, centralized, and better optimized.
